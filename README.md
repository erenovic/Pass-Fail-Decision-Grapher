# Pass-Fail-Decision-Grapher
Many colleges decided on Pass/Fail option in Spring 2020. This Program visualizes possible outcomes and benefits by helping to decide how many credits to take this semester with respect to your prediction on how your future performance (future GPA) and present performance (SPA in Spring 2020) will be.

The given inputs are past number of credits, remaining credits to complete education without including the possible credits that can be taken this semester and the current GPA. 

With changing those variables, the desired output can be implemented with help of a graph and written solution.
